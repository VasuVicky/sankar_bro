Servlet : by abhi.
=======

1. Servlet API  is a part of JEE API  for developing web based applications.
2. The servlet is a server side technology to develope application which are run on Server.
3. The Servlet api provides two packages to implement the servlet in java.

	1.javax.servlet
	2.javax.servlet.http

4.Developing the Servlet application means implementing the Servlet interface directly or indirectly.
5.A servlet program can be developed in 3 ways :

	1.By implementing Servlet Interface.
	2.By extending GeneriServlet class. :inside : javax.servlet
	3.By extending HttpServlet class. : inside : javax.servlet.http

	this is the most widely used class for creating the servlets.

6. javax.servlet package : protocol independent servlets [Generic servlets].

Interfaces : 

There are so many interfaces : but these are the main 

1.Servlet
2.ServletRequest
3.ServletResponse
4.ServletConfig
5.ServletContext
6.RequestDispathcer

Classes :

	1.GenericServlet.

7.javax.servlet.http package : used to develop Http base protocol servlets. this is the widely used package.

Interfaces : 

These are the few important classes and interfaces.

1.HttpServletReuest.
2.HttpServletResponse.
3.HttpSession.

Classes : 

	1.HttpServlet.  : widely used class to develop servlets in java.

Servlet Interface : 
===============

The Servlet interface belongs to javax.servlet package and it contains the following implementation methods.

1.public void init(ServletConfig config){} : 

This method will be executeonly one time, When the servlet object is created or when the first request is sent to the servlet.

2.public void service(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse res){} : 

service() is the main method to perform the actual task i.e It will contains the business logic. The servlet container / web server call the service() method to handle the requests comming from the clients and to send the response back to the client.
The service() method checks the Http request type and calls to their associated methods.
types of requests (i think used in method attribute in the forms)(GET,POST,PUT,DELETE) and it's associated methods are : doGet(), doPost(), doPut() , doDelete() etc..

3.public void destroy() {} : destroy() method is executed only once, when the servlet is timed out / destroyed.

4.public ServletConfig getServletConfig() {} : This method returns the object of the ServletConfig object.

5.public string getServletInfo() {} : This method returns the description about the servletConfig object.

If you want to create a servlet in java then we need to implement all these above method.

life cycle of a servlet : start       running     dead (like thread life cycle).

init()      service()    getServletConfig()   getServletInfo()   destroy()   .
