<h2>Frames : A frame is nothing but a Inner Window.<br/>A Subpart of the window is called Frame.<br/>The entire width and height dimensions of the every window in html is 100%.<br/>
If you want to create multiple frame means if you want to divide the entire window into multiple parts then we use frames. means divide the 100% into separate parts based on our requirements.<br/>But keep main the sum of the all percentages are equals to 100 only.Because that is the size / dimension of the entire window.<br/>To create a Frame using frame tag.<br/>The collection of the frames are called frameset , To create a frame is always inside the frameset, first we need to create the frameset tag inside it create a frames based on the dimensions you divide in the cols or rows in the frameset.<br/>Keep frameset tag after head and befor body.<br/>If there is no frames to display then ends that using noframes tag inside it defines body.<br/>here frame tag allow two main attributes one is name : to define the name of the fram and another is : src : source of the frame to display.<br/>And it is a self closing tag.</h2>
